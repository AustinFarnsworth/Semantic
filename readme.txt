Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 

By structuring it semantically we can see what is actually being used like a form
or the elements within that form to understand it more. 

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 

Some benefits would be a more universal understanding of the semantic elements
and a general consensus on how to use them. 

What are some disadvantages? 

Some disadvantages  could be the lack of creativity and not enough use of branching
out with different or new elements.
